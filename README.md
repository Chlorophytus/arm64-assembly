# Exercism ARM64 Assembly Track

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/arm64-assembly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/arm64-assembly)

Exercism exercises in ARM64 Assembly.

## Assembler

GNU Assembler (gas) is used for this track.

## Testing

Unity is a simple unit testing framework for C used by this track. Using a framework written in C instead of assembly language is easier to understand. It also shows how parameters are passed when calling assembly routines from C.

## Variant and Calling Conventions

This is probably going to use the ARMv8.0-A profile which is a good default. This track is also probably going to use the ARM default calling convention to spare mentors from trouble.
