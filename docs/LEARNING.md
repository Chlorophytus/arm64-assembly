# Learning

ARM64 assembly is a simple assembly language. 
You might be able to start off with [a reference card](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/19wi/arm64.pdf).

ARM also provides [digital reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation) on the ARM64 (AArch64/ARMv8) architecture.

I hope you enjoy learning ARM assembly and working through the exercises. This is a gateway to getting to know your phone or ARM64 based development hardware (the more recent Raspberry Pi models are an example).

If you get stuck with any aspect of your learning or running the tests, the track maintainer Roland (metivier.roland@chlorophyt.us), is happy to help you directly.
