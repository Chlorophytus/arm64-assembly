# Introduction

ARM64 is RISC, meaning there are only a few instructions that constitute its core, making it highly efficient.

## The 31 registers

## Addressing modes

## Comments in binutils assembler

Comments can be used to leave notes for other developers reading the source code.
Single line comments in binutils-assembled ARM64 assembly are preceded by `;`.
