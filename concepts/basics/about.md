# About

- ARM64 is [RISC][reduced-instruction-set-computing]
	- There are only a few instructions that constitute its core.
	- This makes it highly efficient.
	- This is why recent smartphones and other mobile devices almost always implement this architecture.

[AArch64/A64][aarch64] mode will mostly be used in this track.

## The 31 registers

## Addressing modes

## Comments in binutils assembler

Comments can be used to leave notes for other developers reading the source code.
Single line comments in binutils-assembled ARM64 assembly are preceded by `;`.
